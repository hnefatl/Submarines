                                 Instructions

Your submarine has been damaged, and you must use your malfunctioning
radar/sonar equipment to fend off enemy submarines whilst repairing your own.

Your hull will repair over time as your technicians work on it. However, enemy
submarines will appear periodically, and try to destroy you. Normally you'd be
able to destroy them easily, but as the sensor equipment has been damaged, you
won't know all the information about their positions.

In order to launch a torpedo, you need to know 3 things:
Yaw - this is the bearing on the lateral plane (flat)
Pitch - this is the bearing on the vertical plane (upright)
Distance - this is the distance (in m) to the target

You also have a sensor for depth, which, when functioning, gives the vertical
depth difference between your submarine and theirs.

As you don't know all the information at once, you'll need to use trigonometry
and Pythagoras' theorem to find the unknown data.

However, the submarines will not stay still while you manually calculate -
after a while, they will move to a new location, and the data on them will
change. You may even find yourself with data from new instruments, as the
other ones have malfunctioned.

There are 3 types of submarine:
Small - only takes one hit from a torpedo to destroy, but moves sooner.
Medium - takes 2 hits from torpedos, moves slower.
Large - takes 3 hits from torpedos, but moves very slowly.

These submarines will also be firing at you - each torpedo launched uses data
from the submarine that launched it to find you; by destroying the launcher,
the torpedo becomes useless. It will take a while for the torpedos to reach
you, and there is a warning light and noise when there is one incoming. The
faster the beep, the closer the torpedo is to hitting you.

If you can fully repair your hull, you can escape. If your hull is completely
destroyed, you lose.
